## Brief:
According to the experimental data, construct the equations of direct and inverse linear 
regression. To do this, find the coefficients of the regression equation and the correlation 
coefficient. For a straight regression line, estimate the significance of the coefficients 
and the significance of the correlation coefficient using the Student's distribution. 
Test the significance of the equation as a whole using Fisher's F-test. 
Draw a graph of the regression line and mark the location of the experimental data. 
Draw conclusions.
