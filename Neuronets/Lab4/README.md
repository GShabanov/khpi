# Lab4
Demonstration program demonstrating the operation of Hopfield and Hamming networks.

## Brief:
# Hopfield network demonstration

The program learns several images

After this, any of these images may be damaged. This can be done by selecting a new image, and then you can make marks directly on the field.

After this, the image can be restored by pressing the appropriate button. The system, based on its training, will return the image to a previous form.
